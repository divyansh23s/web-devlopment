# Project Folder Repository

This repository contains a folder from a larger project, including only selected files relevant to that folder. This approach helps keep the repository clean and focused on the particular module or feature.

---

## Contents

- Folder: `Form_Login`
- Selected files inside this folder (e.g., source code, assets, configs)
- `.gitignore` configured to exclude unrelated files/folders

---

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get up and running with the code in this folder:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/divyansh23s/web-devlopment.git
cd web-devlopment
2. Install dependencies (if applicable)
If the folder contains a Node.js or similar project, install the dependencies:

npm install

3. Run the project or module
Adjust based on your project type:

npm start
or open HTML files directly if it's a frontend static folder.

How this repository was created
Only the folder Form_Login/ and its selected files are tracked.

Other project folders/files are excluded using .gitignore.

This keeps the repository minimal and focused on the relevant code.

Useful when you want to share or collaborate on a specific module without exposing the entire project.
